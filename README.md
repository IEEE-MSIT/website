## Contribution & Collaboration Workflow

This project operates with a professional development workflow. All contributions, regardless of size, must follow these steps to ensure quality and consistency.

1.  **Find an Issue**  
    All work begins with an issue. Browse the [Issues tab](https://github.com/IEEE-MSIT/website/issues). If your idea doesn't have an issue, create one using our templates.

2.  **Fork & Clone**  
    Fork the repository to your personal account and clone it to your local machine.

3.  **Create a Branch**  
    Create a new branch from `main` with a descriptive name. We follow the `[type]/[short-description]` convention (e.g., `feat/add-event-carousel`, `fix/header-alignment`).

    ```sh
    git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature
    ```

4.  **Develop & Commit**  
    Make your changes. Write clean, well-documented code. Commit your work with clear, conventional commit messages (e.g., `feat: Add user authentication endpoint`).

5.  **Push and Open a Pull Request (PR)**  
    Push your branch to your fork and open a Pull Request against the `main` branch of this repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes in the PR.

6.  **Code Review**  
    Your PR will be reviewed by the Web Dev leadership. Engage in the discussion and make any required changes. At least one approval is required to merge.

### For Content Managers: Updating Website Information

Most of the website's content (events, team members, hackathon results) is managed in a single file. This allows for easy updates without needing to run the project locally.

- **File to Edit:** `src/data/data.ts`

To update content, simply edit this file directly on GitHub, commit your changes to a new branch, and open a Pull Request.
