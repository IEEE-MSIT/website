## About IEEE

IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. IEEE and its members inspire a global community through its highly cited publications, conferences, technology standards, and professional and educational activities. IEEE's roots go back to 1884 when electricity began to become a major influence in society. There was one major established electrical industry, the telegraph, which since the 1840s had come to connect the world with a data communications system faster than the speed of transportation. IEEE, pronounced "Eye-triple-E," stands for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The organization is chartered under this name and it is the full legal name.

## Regions of IEEE

## Asia and Pacific

The Asia Region of IEEE encompasses a diverse landscape of technological innovation and collaboration, serving as a hub for knowledge exchange and professional growth. Within this region, the Indian subcontinent stands out for its significant contributions to technology and innovation, hosting a vibrant engineering community engaged in cutting-edge research and development. Within India, the IEEE Delhi Section plays a crucial role in fostering collaboration and excellence, organizing various technical events and initiatives to drive innovation and societal impact in Delhi and its surrounding areas.

## India Council and Delhi Section

The IEEE India Council is a central hub for managing and promoting IEEE's activities across India, enhancing collaboration among professionals in technology and engineering. It acts as the coordinating body among various IEEE sections and chapters, playing a critical role in hosting numerous major events including technical conferences, workshops, and seminars that are crucial for the professional development and networking of members. The council emphasizes educational outreach and student engagement, supporting Student Branches at many universities and colleges to foster technical activities, competitions, and publications that contribute to both academic and professional growth.

Delhi Section, part of IEEE India Council and Asia-Pacific Region 10, was formed on May 13, 1976. With 3,680 members, it promotes tech education and research through 100+ Student Branches in institutions like Delhi Technological University, IIT Delhi. These branches host activities fostering innovation and professional growth, supported by over 100 branches in institutions such as DTU, IIT Delhi, NSIT, MAIT, and others. They nurture a strong tech community, offering leadership experience and global competition participation.

## OPPORTUNITIES

IEEE is a large organization. Many opportunities for students exist that are not directly sponsored by Student Activities. To ensure that the brightest and most capable young minds have the resources they need to pursue a technologically-oriented education, we have collected information about grants, scholarships, and other opportunities for students for you to search here.

### CONTESTS FOR STUDENTS

The IEEE offers many opportunities for students to win contests for outstanding performance in a variety of areas. Students, here you will be able to search for opportunities to receive recognition and prizes for your innovative thinking and hard work. Sponsors, here you can have the opportunity to recognize some of the best and brightest young engineering minds while taking the opportunity to reinforce your organization's dedication to the support of the next generation of IEEE leaders.

### SAC AWARDS PROGRAMS

Student branches are crucial to the growth and development of IEEE Student members. Student branches create a local network of students and give students the opportunity to meet and learn from fellow students, as well as faculty members and professionals in the field. Student branches offer numerous educational, technical, and professional advantages to IEEE Student members through special projects, activities, meetings, tours, and field trips. However, these activities and advantages aren't done without the effort, labor, and diligence of volunteers. IEEE has created several Student Branch Awards to recognize and reward the efforts of these tireless individuals and teams.

### IEEE MSIT AWARDS

#### 1. Larry K. Wilson Regional Student Activities Award
